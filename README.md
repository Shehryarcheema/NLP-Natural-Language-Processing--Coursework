# NLP-Natural-Language-Processing--Coursework
This project implements five NLP models—MLP, RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Transformer—to compare their performance on text tasks. It includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and accuracy/ BLEU-based analysis, showing how each architecture handles sequence data and highlighting the Transformer’s superior capability.
